ðŸŽ¶ Real-Time Audio-Reactive AI Visual Generator
Overview
This project leverages StyleGAN2-ADA combined with real-time audio analysis to create stunning, audio-reactive visuals for DJs, clubs, and live events. Using advanced machine learning techniques and TouchDesigner as the front end, the system generates high-quality visuals synchronized to music, offering DJs real-time control over creative parameters like temperature, truncation, and style diversity.

Key Features
Audio-Reactive Visuals:

Visuals adapt to the music's BPM, generating new frames on key beats (e.g., every 4th or 8th beat).
Smooth interpolation between frames for continuous and seamless visuals.
StyleGAN2-ADA:

Generates high-quality, intricate visuals in real time or near real-time.
Optimized for efficient frame generation and audio synchronization.
Customizable DJ Dashboard:

Real-time controls for parameters like temperature, truncation, top-k, and style selection.
BPM synchronization ensures visuals align perfectly with the rhythm.
Cloud-Based Processing:

Uses scalable AWS EC2 GPU instances to handle computationally intensive tasks.
Offers a subscription-based model for DJs, reducing upfront hardware costs.
TouchDesigner Integration:

Acts as the real-time rendering engine for live performances.
Adds dynamic effects, transitions, and audio-reactive overlays to StyleGAN outputs.
Architecture
Audio Processing:

Librosa extracts tempo, beats, and spectral features from the audio in real time.
Syncs frame generation with the detected BPM for rhythmic visual updates.
Generative AI:

VAE (Variational Autoencoder) processes audio features into latent vectors.
StyleGAN2-ADA generates visuals based on these latent vectors, with parameters customizable by the user.
TouchDesigner:

Receives generated visuals and applies additional effects (e.g., particle systems, 3D transformations).
Acts as the display engine for live events.
Cloud Integration:

AWS EC2 with NVIDIA A100 GPUs handles visual generation.
Amazon S3 stores pre-generated visuals for quick retrieval.
AWS IVS or WebRTC streams visuals in real time to DJs and their audiences.
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash

Use Amazon S3 for storing pre-generated visuals.
Usage
Run the Audio Processor:

Analyze audio to extract beats and tempo:
python
Copy code
import librosa
# Load audio file
y, sr = librosa.load('your_audio_file.wav', sr=22050)
tempo, beat_frames = librosa.beat.beat_track(y=y, sr=sr)
Generate Latent Vectors:

Convert audio features to latent vectors using the VAE.
Generate Visuals:

Pass latent vectors to StyleGAN2-ADA to create visuals.
Stream Visuals to TouchDesigner:

Use Spout or NDI to send generated visuals to TouchDesigner for rendering.
Deploy Cloud App (Optional):

Use Streamlit or AWS Amplify to create a DJ-facing dashboard.
Integrate cloud services for scalable performance.
Future Plans
Enhanced Interactivity:
Add real-time controls for DJs to tweak visual parameters during live performances.
Optimized Cloud Processing:
Deploy autoscaling GPU instances to support multiple users simultaneously.
Pre-Trained Models:
Offer pre-generated themes (e.g., abstract, geometric, nature-inspired) for quick use.
